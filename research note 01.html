  <h1>INTUS – Metacognition Laboratory</h1>
  <p class="tagline">
    An independent research initiative investigating contradiction-driven epistemic reasoning
    and neurosymbolic approaches to AI cognition.
  </p>

  <span class="badge">Laboratory Overview</span>

  <h2>Our Mission</h2>
  <p>
    We investigate how an artificial system might detect contradictions, generate hypotheses,
    integrate them into memory, and track how those internal structures evolve. Our research pipeline 
    approaches reasoning as a regulated feedback process: tensions in input trigger hypothesis 
    generation, hypotheses are tested against accumulated memory, and accepted insights reshape 
    the system's conceptual space.
  </p>

  <h2>Core Research Areas</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Abductive reasoning and hypothesis generation</li>
    <li>Contradiction driven inference and belief revision</li>
    <li>Ontology grounded reasoning and semantic drift</li>
    <li>Epistemic stability and meta level control mechanisms</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Research Note 01</h3>
  <h1>Why Contradiction Is Not an Error in Reasoning</h1>
  
  <span class="badge">Conceptual v0.1</span>
  
  <p style="margin-top:1.5rem;"><strong>Author:</strong> Kristjan Gorenc<br>
  <strong>Affiliation:</strong> INTUS – Metacognition Laboratory (Slovenia)<br>
  <strong>Last updated:</strong> 2025-12-22</p>

  <h2>Abstract</h2>
  <p>
    Contradiction is conventionally understood as a terminal failure state, a signal that
    reasoning has broken down. Classical logic embodies this intuition through the
    Principle of Explosion (<em>P</em>, ¬<em>P</em> ⊢ <em>Q</em>): from contradictory premises,
    anything follows. Yet across the philosophy of science, medical practice, and
    engineering, we observe systematic patterns where contradictions are not only tolerated
    but can be functionally necessary for progress.
  </p>
  <p>
    This note argues that the puzzle dissolves when we distinguish <strong>logical contradiction</strong>
    (a formal property of statements) from <strong>epistemic contradiction</strong>
    (a functional state of inquiry under uncertainty). We suggest that systems which
    eliminate epistemic contradictions prematurely tend to become brittle, while systems
    that maintain them strategically can exhibit more robust inquiry and revision.
  </p>

  <h2>1. The Logic Reasoning Divorce</h2>
  <p>
    A key clarification follows Gilbert Harman’s insight that <strong>logic is not the same as reasoning</strong>.
    Logic studies relations of consequence among propositions; reasoning concerns how an
    agent updates beliefs over time in response to evidence, conflict, and limited resources.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Formal logic</strong> emphasizes truth-preservation and consequence.</li>
    <li><strong>Human reasoning</strong> emphasizes justification, revision, and inquiry management.</li>
    <li><strong>Inconsistency</strong> is fatal to certain formal systems, but in inquiry it often triggers belief revision rather than collapse.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. Case Studies: Productive Inconsistency</h2>

  <h3>2.1 Physics: Living in the Contradiction</h3>
  <p>
    The transition from classical to quantum physics was a sustained period of “living with” incompatible models.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Planck (1900):</strong> Historically described as a forced move driven by empirical tension, quantization addressed contradictions between classical theory and blackbody radiation data.</li>
    <li><strong>Einstein (1905–1927):</strong> For decades, light was treated as both wave-like and particle-like, serving as a pragmatic dual modeling strategy.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>2.2 Geology: The Cost of Suppression</h3>
  <p>
    Alfred Wegener (1912) assembled evidence for continental drift, but it was broadly rejected partly because a convincing physical mechanism was missing. Treating the absence of mechanism as decisive can suppress inquiry; the eventual emergence of plate tectonics resolved the tension, but only after decades of lost time.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Applied Domains: Medicine &amp; Engineering</h2>

  <h3>3.1 Medicine: “Rule Out” Culture</h3>
  <p>
    In clinical reasoning, contradiction is institutionalized through <strong>differential diagnosis</strong>.
    Clinicians hold mutually exclusive hypotheses simultaneously until evidence resolves the conflict. A major contributor to diagnostic error is <strong>premature closure</strong>: settling on one explanation too early and ceasing hypothesis search.
  </p>

  

  <h3>3.2 Engineering: The Art of Satisficing</h3>
  <p>
    Herbert Simon argued that problem solving often aims at “satisficing” rather than global optimization:
    engineers manage contradictions among cost, safety, and performance. Conversely, <strong>normalization of deviance</strong>—where warning signals are reinterpreted as acceptable drift—can lead to institutional failure, as seen in the Challenger disaster analysis.
  </p>

  

  <h2>4. Toward a Functional View: Contradiction as Signal</h2>
  <p>
    Epistemic contradictions serve as informative signals that direct attention to where revision is needed. Their functional roles include:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Boundary detection:</strong> Marking where the current model hits the “wall” of reality.</li>
    <li><strong>Evidence accumulation:</strong> Acting as a pause signal that prevents premature commitment.</li>
    <li><strong>Framework revision:</strong> Signaling the need for deeper conceptual change.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><em>The pain analogy:</em> Just as physical pain signals tissue damage without being the damage itself, epistemic contradiction signals model inadequacy without being a reasoning failure.</p>
