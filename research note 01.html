    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>
      Contradiction is often treated as a terminal failure state: a sign that reasoning has broken down. Classical logic
      captures this intuition via the <em>Principle of Explosion</em> (from <code>P</code> and <code>¬P</code>, one may derive any <code>Q</code>),
      but this “explosion” is a property of <em>classical consequence relations</em> a formal design choice for truth preserving derivation,
      not a universal law of rational inquiry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Across philosophy of science, medicine, and engineering, agents routinely continue to function under unresolved tensions.
      The puzzle dissolves once we distinguish <strong>logical contradiction</strong> (a formal inconsistency inside a set of statements)
      from <strong>epistemic contradiction</strong> (a functional state where evidence, models, or constraints support incompatible commitments
      under uncertainty). Many real world “contradictions” are also better described as <strong>contraries</strong> (they cannot both be true,
      but can both be false), which further explains why inquiry does not “explode.”
    </p>
    <p>
      We propose that premature elimination of epistemic contradictions tends to create brittle inquiry (premature closure, suppressed anomalies,
      institutional normalization), while strategic maintenance of tension supports robust revision. We call this productive tension
      <strong>epistemic friction</strong>: a local loss of coherence that provides traction for learning and model repair.
    </p>

    <div class="callout">
      <p><strong>Working distinction (minimal):</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Logical contradiction:</strong> <code>P ∧ ¬P</code> (in classical logic: inconsistent, explosive under classical consequence).</li>
        <li><strong>Epistemic contradiction:</strong> a conflict among models/evidence/constraints that signals “the map is incomplete,” not “anything follows.”</li>
        <li><strong>Contrariety (common in practice):</strong> hypotheses that cannot both be true, yet can both be false (e.g., competing diagnoses).</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>1. The Logic–Reasoning Divorce</h2>
    <p>
      A key clarification follows Gilbert Harman’s insight that logic is not the same as reasoning.
      Logic studies consequence relations among propositions; reasoning concerns how agents update beliefs over time under limited evidence,
      conflict, and resource constraints.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Formal logic</strong> prioritizes truth-preservation and consequence within a fixed premise set.</li>
      <li><strong>Reasoning</strong> prioritizes justification, revision, and inquiry management over time.</li>
      <li>Inconsistency is fatal to certain <em>formal</em> systems; in inquiry it often triggers <em>revision</em>, not collapse.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Case Studies: Productive Inconsistency</h2>
    <p class="small">[Insert image: double-slit interference pattern]</p>

    <h2>2.1 Physics: Living With Incompatible Models</h2>
    <p>
      The transition from classical to quantum physics involved sustained periods of working with incompatible commitments rather than eliminating them.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Planck (1900):</strong> quantization emerges as an empirically forced move amid tension between classical expectations and radiation data.
        (A common retrospective framing invokes the “ultraviolet catastrophe,” but Planck’s immediate problem was fitting the observed spectrum and
        then finding a derivation that resisted classical continuity assumptions.)
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Einstein to early quantum theory (1905–1927):</strong> light is treated as wave-like for interference and particle-like for photoelectric effects,
        functioning as a pragmatic dual-model regime.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Bohr (1913):</strong> the atomic model combines classical orbital mechanics with quantum jumps—an internally hybrid move that was
        “inconsistent by construction,” yet scientifically productive.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2.2 Geology: The Cost of Suppressing Tension</h2>
    <p>
      Wegener (1912) assembled evidence for continental drift, but the absence of a convincing mechanism was often treated as decisive.
      Privileging “mechanism now” over “evidence now” can suppress inquiry. The later plate tectonics synthesis resolved the tension,
      but only after decades of delay.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Applied Domains: Medicine &amp; Engineering</h2>

    <h2>3.1 Medicine: Differential Diagnosis as Managed Contradiction</h2>
    <p>
      In clinical reasoning, tension is institutionalized through differential diagnosis. Clinicians maintain mutually exclusive hypotheses
      (often contraries) in parallel until evidence resolves the conflict. A major contributor to diagnostic error is <strong>premature closure</strong>:
      settling on one explanation too early and halting the search. Under time pressure, <strong>availability bias</strong> can accelerate this collapse
      by favoring the most recently seen or most salient diagnosis.
    </p>

    <h2>3.2 Engineering: Satisficing and the Dangers of Normalization</h2>
    <p>
      Herbert Simon argued that problem solving often aims at <strong>satisficing</strong> rather than global optimization:
      engineers routinely manage trade offs among cost, safety, and performance. However, when deviations from design assumptions are repeatedly
      reinterpreted as acceptable drift (<strong>normalization of deviance</strong>), systems can fail catastrophically famously illustrated in analyses
      of the Challenger disaster.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Toward a Functional View: Contradiction as Signal</h2>
    <p>
      Epistemic contradictions (and contrarieties) can function as <strong>informative signals</strong> directing attention toward model limits and revision targets.
      This is <strong>epistemic friction</strong>: local incoherence that provides traction for discovery and correction.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Boundary detection:</strong> marks where the current model hits the “wall” of reality.</li>
      <li><strong>Evidence accumulation:</strong> acts as a pause signal that prevents premature commitment.</li>
      <li><strong>Framework revision:</strong> signals the need for deeper conceptual change (not merely parameter tuning).</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Pain analogy:</strong> just as pain signals tissue damage without being the damage itself, epistemic contradiction signals model inadequacy
        without itself being a reasoning failure. (Like pain, it can be misleading; its rational value lies in how it is investigated and regulated.)
      </li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout">
      <p><strong>One-line takeaway:</strong> Classical logic treats contradictions as toxic to derivation; real world inquiry treats epistemic conflict as a diagnostic signal for model repair.</p>
