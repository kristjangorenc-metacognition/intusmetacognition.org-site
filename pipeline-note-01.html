            <p>
                INTUS is a diagnostic reasoning system that analyzes semantic inconsistency by treating
                <span class="highlight">detected contradictions—rather than tokens or embeddings—as primary computational units</span>.
                The system operates on top of standard Natural Language Inference (NLI) models, using them solely as bounded detectors
                of entailment, contradiction, and neutrality between statement pairs.
            </p>

            <p>
                Contradictions identified by NLI are reified as persistent relational objects and organized into a topological structure that
                captures their recurrence, connectivity, and stability across paraphrases, documents, and processing cycles. Instead of smoothing
                inconsistencies through probabilistic aggregation, INTUS preserves them as first-class structure and analyzes their distribution
                as a semantic pressure field.
            </p>

            <p>
                The system performs structural compression by clustering and tracking contradiction patterns over time, producing a compact
                representation of instability in the underlying semantic space. All outputs are model-relative, corpus-bounded, and fully traceable
                to the originating NLI judgments.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>At its current stage, INTUS functions as a non-generative diagnostic layer:</strong>
                it does not enforce resolution or collapse of inconsistency, but maintains semantic conflict as an explicit, inspectable signal
                within the system.
            </p>

            <p>
                All reported contradiction structures remain explicitly linked to the originating source segments
                (document, section, excerpt) that produced the detector judgment.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Core Design Invariants</h2>

            <p>
                INTUS behavior is governed by a set of explicit design invariants that define its epistemic scope and constrain all architectural
                choices.
            </p>

            <p>
                These invariants define INTUS as a diagnostic substrate rather than a reasoning authority.
                They constrain what the system is permitted to observe, preserve, and expose.
            </p>

            <div class="invariants">
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Detector-Boundedness:</strong> INTUS cannot observe or act on semantic relations not produced by its detectors.</li>
                    <li><strong>No Contradiction Invention:</strong> The system does not generate contradictions beyond detector output.</li>
                    <li><strong>No Implicit Contradiction Elimination:</strong> Detected contradictions are not removed, averaged, or collapsed by default.</li>
                    <li><strong>Persistence Across Cycles:</strong> Contradiction objects may persist across reasoning cycles unless explicitly resolved.</li>
                    <li><strong>Non-Generativity:</strong> INTUS does not generate semantic conclusions, beliefs, or answers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Traceability:</strong> All structural representations are traceable to specific detector judgments.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <p>
                These invariants differentiate INTUS from consistency-enforcing systems and establish its role as a diagnostic instrument rather than a
                generative reasoning engine.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Conceptual Shift</h2>

            <p>
                Most contemporary reasoning systems are optimized to produce internally consistent outputs. In doing so, they implicitly suppress,
                average out, or discard internal inconsistencies during inference or aggregation. While effective for generating coherent responses,
                this design choice obscures <em>epistemic strain</em>: regions of semantic space where interpretation is unstable, contested, or
                structurally incompatible.
            </p>

            <p>
                INTUS takes a diagnostic approach. Rather than treating inconsistency as an error to be eliminated, it is preserved and analyzed as a
                <strong>diagnostic signal</strong>. The system addresses the following question:
            </p>

            <p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic; padding: 20px; font-size: 1.1em;">
                How can semantic inconsistency be detected, preserved, and accumulated as a first-class structural signal, without requiring its
                immediate resolution?
            </p>

            <p>
                The system is designed to <strong>expose epistemic strain</strong>, not to resolve it. Resolution, adjudication, or belief update are
                intentionally external to the diagnostic core.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Bounded Detection and Compression</h2>

            <p>
                INTUS is a <strong>detector-driven diagnostic system</strong>. It operates on the outputs of bounded semantic detectors, including but
                not limited to NLI models. It does not reason directly over text, but over relations exposed by bounded detectors.
            </p>

            <p>
                As with any detector-driven system, the structures available to INTUS are constrained by the resolution, biases, and failure modes of
                the underlying detection mechanisms.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>INTUS does not claim access to uncompressed semantic space</strong>, nor does it attempt to recover information lost during
                upstream inference. The contribution lies not in eliminating detector-induced compression, but in reifying detected inconsistency as a
                persistent structural signal.
            </p>

            <p>
                While upstream detectors may collapse uncertainty into discrete judgments, INTUS preserves and organizes these judgments as relational
                objects, enabling <em>structural compression over failure events</em> rather than probabilistic smoothing over content.
            </p>

            <p>
                Improvements in detector fidelity expand the observable inconsistency field without altering the core reasoning architecture. The
                system's representational power scales with detection quality while remaining explicitly bounded by it.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Topological Organization</h2>

            <p>
                Contradiction objects are not treated as isolated events. INTUS organizes them into a topological structure—a
                <strong>semantic pressure field</strong>—that captures:
            </p>

            <ul style="margin-left: 40px; margin-top: 15px;">
                <li>Recurrence of the same contradiction under paraphrase</li>
                <li>Connectivity between related contradictions</li>
                <li>Clustering of contradictions across documents or cycles</li>
                <li>Temporal persistence and stability</li>
            </ul>

            <p style="margin-top: 20px;">
                This topology reflects only detected relations. INTUS does not infer hidden contradictions or extrapolate beyond detector output. The
                pressure field represents <em>where and how semantic interpretation resists compression into a single stable reading</em>.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Relationship to Generative Systems</h2>

            <p>
                INTUS is not a generative model and does not produce answers, explanations, or conclusions. Its role is diagnostic.
            </p>

            <p>
                When coupled to generative systems, INTUS is intended to function as a <strong>bounding and auditing layer</strong>, exposing internal
                contradictions, unsupported assertions, or epistemic strain in generated outputs.
            </p>

            <p>
                Such coupling is optional and external to the architecture described here.
            </p>
        </section>

        <div class="scope-box">
            <h3>Scope of These Notes</h3>

            <p>
                These notes describe the <strong>diagnostic core only</strong>. The following are explicitly out of scope:
            </p>

            <ul style="margin-top: 10px; padding-left: 25px;">
                <li>Resolution mechanisms or enforcement policies</li>
                <li>Generative coupling or LLM integration (implementation)</li>
                <li>Belief alignment or normative adjudication</li>
                <li>Downstream task performance optimization</li>
            </ul>

            <p style="margin-top: 15px;">
                Any resolution, prioritization, or intervention applied to contradictions must be governed by external policy layers, intentionally
                separated from the core diagnostic architecture.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="not-claims">
            <h3>What INTUS Does NOT Claim</h3>

            <p>
                To prevent misinterpretation, INTUS makes <strong>no claims</strong> regarding:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Semantic truth or normative correctness</li>
                <li>Belief alignment or consistency restoration</li>
                <li>Optimal resolution of contradictions</li>
                <li>Task performance superiority</li>
                <li>Access to uncompressed semantic ground truth</li>
            </ul>

            <p style="margin-top: 15px;">
                <strong>INTUS is diagnostic, not adjudicative.</strong> It exposes structural instability but does not prescribe how to resolve it.
            </p>
        </div>

        <section>
            <h2>Relationship to Paraconsistent Logic</h2>

            <p>
                INTUS deliberately preserves detected contradictions as persistent structural objects, which raises questions about its relationship to
                paraconsistent logic.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>INTUS does not implement a paraconsistent logic.</strong> All semantic detection mechanisms remain grounded in classical logic
                assumptions. Contradictions are detected relative to classical entailment, not reinterpreted or weakened at the logical level.
            </p>

            <p>
                The distinction lies in <em>where</em> contradiction is handled:
            </p>

            <ul style="margin-left: 40px; margin-top: 15px;">
                <li><strong>Paraconsistent logics</strong> alter inference rules to permit inconsistent propositions while redefining entailment.</li>
                <li><strong>INTUS</strong> treats contradiction as an external control signal. Classical reasoning remains intact; contradictions regulate
                    which hypotheses may exert influence through architectural gating.</li>
            </ul>

            <p style="margin-top: 20px;">
                Explosion is avoided not by changing logic, but by gating effects. INTUS respects the principle of explosion at the logical level while
                preventing its practical consequences through architectural constraints.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Current Status</h2>

            <p>
                A demonstration implementation was completed in January 2026 focusing on cross-document contradiction detection in regulatory texts.
            </p>

            <p>
                The demonstration surfaced cross-document tension regions that are typically obscured by summarization-first or
                consistency-enforcing workflows.
            </p>

            <p>
                Ablation experiments indicate that persistent structural memory produces monotonic accumulation of semantic pressure, and that removing
                contradiction-specific structure collapses diagnostic visibility. (Updated comparative plots for the current architecture are in
                regeneration due to ongoing fixes in cross-document closure logic.)
            </p>

            <p>
                Next planned work includes typed detector expansion (e.g., numeric, temporal, definitional) and Phase-4 relational claims / predicate
                lenses, while preserving diagnostic invariants.
