  <h1>Zavod INTUS – Metacognition Lab</h1>
  <p class="tagline">
    An independent research initiative studying how systems form understanding, resolve contradictions, and build coherent models of the world.
  </p>

  <span class="badge">Website in preparation</span>

  <h2>About the lab</h2>
  <p>
    Zavod INTUS explores new approaches to artificial reasoning and cognitive modelling.
    Our focus is on the foundations of understanding: how systems detect inconsistency,
    update beliefs, integrate knowledge, and maintain coherence over time.
  </p>
  <p>
    The lab operates at the intersection of cognitive science, computational reasoning,
    philosophy of mind, and AI safety. Our work is currently in an early research phase,
    with active development of internal prototypes and methodological tools.
  </p>

  <h2>Our mission</h2>
  <p>
     INTUS investigates how an artificial system might
    detect contradictions, generate hypotheses, integrate them into memory, and track how those
    internal structures evolve. The aim is not to replicate human cognition, but to design a
    transparent, modular, and logically grounded epistemic engine that can explain its steps,
    expose its internal tensions, and update its conceptual structure through cycles of
    self-evaluation.
  </p>
  <p>
    Current large-scale AI architectures are strong pattern generators, but they seldom represent
    epistemic coherence explicitly. They typically do not track how beliefs emerge, how they
    interact, or how they should be revised when confronted with conflict. INTUS approaches
    reasoning as a regulated feedback process: tensions in input trigger hypothesis generation,
    hypotheses are tested against accumulated memory, and accepted insights reshape the system’s
    conceptual space.
  </p>

<h2>Theoretical motivation</h2>
  <p>
    The project is informed by epistemology, cognitive systems theory, cybernetics, and the study
    of how minds manage uncertainty. The working hypothesis is that intelligence depends not only
    on recognising patterns, but also on forming structured internal representations, evaluating
    their coherence, and updating them when they conflict with experience.
  </p>
  <p>
    INTUS develops computational tools for detecting semantic tension, tracking conceptual drift,
    resolving contradictions, and constructing explicit justification structures that reveal how
    beliefs depend on and influence one another. In this view, knowledge is treated as a living
    system: something that must remain organised, interpretable, and internally consistent across
    time and across domains.
  </p>

  <h2>What’s coming next</h2>
  <p>
    A full website will be published once a small but serious public research package is ready.

    These will give a clear and grounded overview of the project’s direction
    and early results and will serve as the foundation for scientific outreach,
    and future collaborations.
  </p>

<h2>Zavod INTUS</h2>
  <p>
