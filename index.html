  <h1>INTUS – Metacognition Laboratory</h1>
  <p class="tagline">
    An independent research initiative investigating contradiction driven epistemic reasoning
    and neurosymbolic approaches to AI cognition.
  </p>

  <span class="badge">Website in preparation</span>

  <h2>Our Mission</h2>
  <p>
    We investigate how an artificial system might detect contradictions, generate hypotheses,
    integrate them into memory, and track how those internal structures evolve. The aim is not
    to replicate human cognition, but to design and experimentally study transparent, modular,
    and logically grounded epistemic pipelines that can explain their steps, expose internal
    tensions, and update their conceptual structure through cycles of self-evaluation.
  </p>
  <p>
    Current large scale AI architectures are strong pattern generators, but they seldom represent
    epistemic coherence explicitly. They typically do not track how beliefs emerge, how they
    interact, or how they should be revised when confronted with conflict. Our research pipeline
    approaches reasoning as a regulated feedback process: tensions in input trigger hypothesis
    generation, hypotheses are tested against accumulated memory, and accepted insights reshape
    the system's conceptual space.
  </p>

  Read our first conceptual inquiry:
  <a href="research note 01.html">Why Contradiction Is Not an Error in Reasoning</a>
  </p>
  
  <h2>Central Question</h2>
  <p>
    <em>How far can a contradiction-driven epistemic approach, equipped with structured memory
    and explicit reasoning mechanisms, scale toward robust, interpretable, domain-general
    intelligence?</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    Rather than presenting a finished AI system, this is a <strong>research inquiry</strong> a
    methodological framework for testing epistemic ideas in a controlled, inspectable way.
  </p>

  <h2>Foundations</h2>
  <p>
    This research represents a cross-disciplinary synthesis drawing from cognitive science,
    epistemology, systems theory, neuro-symbolic AI, computational linguistics, and formal
    reasoning. Initial testbeds focus on biology, physiology, pathology, and medicine domains
    where reasoning must be causal, precise, and resilient under uncertainty. The pipeline,
    which we call INTUS, situates itself within research traditions of belief revision,
    abductive inference, structured memory, and feedback regulation.
  </p>

  <h2>Core Research Areas</h2>
  <p>
    Our work explores several interconnected theoretical and computational challenges:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>abductive reasoning and hypothesis generation,</li>
    <li>contradiction driven inference and belief revision,</li>
    <li>ontology grounded reasoning and semantic drift,</li>
    <li>structural vs probabilistic approaches to reasoning,</li>
    <li>epistemic stability and meta level control mechanisms.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Development Status</h2>
  <p>
    This is an exploratory and evolving project, built from first principles and tested
    iteratively across synthetic, clinical, lexical, and narrative environments. The current
    implementation is a working research prototype designed to test theoretical ideas about
    epistemic reasoning and cognitive architecture.
  </p>

  <h2>What's Coming Next</h2>
  <p>
    A full website will be published once initial research materials are ready.
  </p>

  <h2>Collaboration</h2>
  <p>
    We welcome contact from researchers and practitioners interested in:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>epistemic and contradiction-aware reasoning systems,</li>
    <li>neuro-symbolic and hybrid cognitive architectures,</li>
    <li>formal and informal theories of belief revision and explanation,</li>
    <li>applications in medicine, law, and other high-stakes reasoning domains,</li>
    <li>AI safety, interpretability, and epistemic robustness.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>
    INTUS is an independent metacognition laboratory based in Slovenia, focusing on epistemic
    AI, cognitive architectures, and symbolic–statistical hybrid reasoning systems.
